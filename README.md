# Academic Repos

This repo is used to store any academic related things. They are usually in Bahasa Indonesia - since I teach in Indonesia - while maybe occasionally I also write things in English. Feel free to browse this repo. All contents are Creative Common CC-BY-SA licensed:

This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work 
even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and 
license their new creations under the identical terms. This 
license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source 
software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the 
same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. 
This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for 
materials that would benefit from incorporating content from 
Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.
